# WebGL cloth simulation 
This project is a 3D tool that helps arists study fabric behavior, focusing on what is know to artists as 'spiral folds'. You can see this type of fold in everyday life when you roll up your sleeves. It's what happens when fabric wraps around something rigid (like your arm) and gets compressed, creating a spiral pattern in the material.
